# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: "I am Professor of Social and Intercultural Psychology in the Department of Psychology at Durham University (UK), where I lead the Quantitative Social Psychology Research Group. I am also honorary senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne and at the Australian National University, adjunct professor at Western Sydney University and a former Associate Professor at the University of Newcastle (Australia).

  My research and teaching specialise on the psychology of diversity and social cohesion; I investigate the determinants and consequences of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination, as well as ways to mitigate these problems. I am the author of over 55 peer reviewed journal articles and book chapters and I have delivered 120+ conference papers and book contributions. I am best known for my research on intergroup friendship in sectarian Northern Ireland, my theoretical and empirical syntheses on stereotype formation and change, research on negative intergroup contact and contact valence asymmetries. My more recent contributions are on topics of intergroup contact seeking and avoidance and contact volition. My research is highly cited by peers and is discussed in policy briefs by peak organisations like the WorldBank, the United Nations, and UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission. It has earned science and research awards by the (US-led) Academy of Management and the Australian Psychological Society."
