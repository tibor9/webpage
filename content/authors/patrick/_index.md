Patrick Kotzur is an Assistant Professor in Psychology in the Quantitative Social Psychology Group at Durham University.

He is very interested in what factors and processes shape how we respond to people we feel do not belong to "us", as well as the consequences of these perceptions. His current work focusses on questions related to stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination; that is, how we preceive others, why we perceive them as such, what consequences these perceptions have, and how to change these perceptions, with a particular interest in intergroup contact. He primarily uses longitudinal research designs, but enjoys conducting experiments and cross-sectional surveys, too.

Patrick studied Intercultural Relations and Behaviour at Jacobs University (Germany; now known as Constructor University) and Applied Social Psychology at Sussex University (UK). He received a Dr. rer. nat. (PhD equivalent) in Psychology from the University of Marburg (Germany) and worked as a postdoc at the University of Osnabrück (Germany).

Patrick also has a thing for "Plants vs. Zombies 2" and can't stop levelling up his plants.
